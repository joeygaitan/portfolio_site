# Django Application testing URLs, Views, and queries

1. Django is different to node and flask because it comes more organized, and everything is pre build in its own heirarchy file structure. Instead of building it out right your own way you have to stick to a standard.
* The role for urls.py is to determine the root route or intial route to allow functionality later with adding on queries.
* The role of views.py is the functionality or action to the browser from the given url.

2. The first url is a kind of root url that sets up your intial url route. The other url file is everything after that intial one. It allows for more detail to that route and scripting.

3. The desire to split our code gives our page more functionality to work with. Such as login/ or posts/. These each require their own unique actions or api calls to do thier tasks.
